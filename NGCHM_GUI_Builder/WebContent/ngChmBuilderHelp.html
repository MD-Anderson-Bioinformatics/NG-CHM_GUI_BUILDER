		    <h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The NG-CHM Heat Map Builder provides a graphical user interface for users to easily construct heat maps from their own matrix data. The interface 
			presents a step-by-step process that takes the user from the selection of an input matrix to the presentation of a newly created heat map in an embedded
			NG-CHM Heat Map Viewer. The heat map may then be saved as a portable .NGCHM file, which may be viewed in the NG-CHM File Viewer application, and/or 
			saved as a PDF.</p>
			<p>The NG-CHM Heat Map builder breaks the process of constructing a fully-functioning interactive heat map into a series of steps, a data entry screen for
			each, that walk the user through the construction process:</p>
			<p/>
			<p><b><a href="#Matrix">Step 1: Select Matrix</b></a></p>  
			<p><b><a href="#Transform">Step 2: Transform Matrix</b></a></p>  
			<p><b><a href="#Cluster">Step 3: Cluster Matrix</b></a></p> 
			<p><b><a href="#Covariates">Step 4: Process Covariates</b></a></p>   
			<p><b><a href="#Format">Step 5: Format Heat Map</b></a></p>   
			<p><b><a href="#Heatmap">Step 6: Interactive Heat Map</b></a></p>  
			<p/>
			<p>Each screen of the NG-CHM Heat Map Builder contains two panels: The <b>Configuration Panel</b> on the left side of the screen and the <b>Results Panel</b> on the right.</p>
			<p><b>The Configuration Panel.</b></p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><p style="text-align:left;"><img src='images/help/LeftPanelExample.png' height="500" width="244"></p></td>
					<td valign="top">		<p>An NG-CHM Builder screen's configuration panel provides the user with options for the current step in the heat map building process. Each configuration panel contains a series 
			of configuration controls (e.g. text entry, drop-down list, checkbox, etc...))to make configuration changes to the map. Within this panel the user may make configuration changes to their heat map, apply those changes, 
			and navigate to the next screen.  Backwards navigation to the previous screen is also possible. The details for all of the configuration controls can be found in 
			the sub-sections (below) for each of the screens in the application. </p>
			<p><img src='images/help/AdvancedFeatures.png' height="15" width="150"> The available configuration options for all data-entry panels in the application are broken into those features that are advanced

			<p><b>The Results Panel.</b></p>
			<p>The Results Panel, located on the right side of the screen, allows the user to see the results of changes applied during data entry. In this way a user may iterate within

			<p>A short video tutorial to introduce the various capabilities and controls of the NG-CHM GUI Builder: <a href="" target="new">TBD</a></p>
		    
			<a name="Matrix"></a>
		    <h2>Step 1:  NG-CHM BUILDER: Select Matrix </h2>
	
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='images/help/screenMatrix.png' height="452" width="800"></p>
			
			<p>The first step in building a heat map with the NG-CHM Builder is to select a matrix file for the heat map. On this screen the user can 
			open their own file or choose to use a sample file provided with the application. Users may select a matrix and enter
			information for the new heat map by making selections and entries on the configuration panel.</p>
			
			<p> NG-CHM heat maps require a tab delimited text file containing a matrix of data. The file must have row and column headers with labels that 
			identify the content of the rows/columns and numeric values in the remainder of the matrix. Use the Open Matrix File button to load your matrix. 
			If you don't have a matrix and want to try the application, the Sample Matrix open button may used to open a matrix file that will allow you to 
			explore the features of the application.</p>
			
			<p>Once a matrix file has been selected and opened, the Results Panel will be populated with data from the matrix.  The Results Panel on this particular
			screen of the NG-CHM Builder application differs from other screens in the application in that the user can perform some select configuration tasks in the panel.  
			These allow the user to select locations in the matrix where labels and data are located. Matrix data may begin in a position other than (1,1) in the matrix. 
			Users may select the location of the label row and label column as well as pick a starting point for the matrix data by selecting from the radio buttons above the matrix
			and then clicking on the displayed matrix itself to make a selection. The colors blue (labels) and green (data) are displayed on the matrix to show your selections.
			The system default is row 1 column 1 for row and column labels, respectively, and (2,2) for matrix data start location.</p> 
			
			<p>Advanced users may choose the option to open a file that contains embedded covariate file data located within the matrix itself.
			In these cases the covariate data will be represented by rows and columns in the matrix. Controls on the results panel allow the user to select 
			the locations of covariate bars on each axis. The color yellow is displayed on the matrix to show covariate selections. If covariate bars are selected 
			within the matrix, the configuration panel will be expanded to allow users to select the color type (discrete/continuous) for each bar. </p>

			<p>Once a matrix has been selected and all required data entered, the user may move on to the next step in the NG-CHM Builder heat map creation process: 
			Transform Matrix.</p>
			
			<a name="Transform"></a>
		    <h2>Step 2:  NG-CHM BUILDER: Transform Matrix </h2>
	
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='images/help/screenTransform.png' height="452" width="800"></p>
	
			<p>	Once a matrix has been selected, the user may perform a number of different operations to transform and filter the data in the matrix prior to heat map construction. 
			Filters and transforms can be used to manipulate the matrix to produce better heat maps. For example, a Z-norm transform could be used to normalize rows with values 
			that differ in magnitude and a standard deviation filter could be used to remove rows with values that do not differ much across the columns. 
			The Transform Matrix screen presents these options to the user and allows them to perform a sequence of changes to modify the contents of the input matrix.</p> 
	
			<p>The configuration panel begins with a drop-down selection that contains options for the different types of actions that may be performed in transforming/filtering a matrix.
			Each of these options will reveal a different panel containing configuration controls for that action. A user may select a transform method, enter values (where necessary)
			for the transform, and execute that modification to the matrix. As each transform is applied a line describing the change is added to a Matrix Change History list. 
			At any point in the process of transforming the matrix, the user may restore the modified matrix to a previous step by clicking on a change in the history list and 
			then clicking the "reset" button.</p>
	
			<p>The Results panel on the Transform Matrix screen presents an image of the top left corner of the matrix as changes are being applied. This panel also provides summary statistics 
			of your matrix data including the distribution of values and row/column standard deviations. In this way, the user may visually confirm that the transforms and filters being applied
			are producing the expected results.</p>

			<p>Once all transformations have been applied to the original data matrix, the user may move on to the next step in the NG-CHM Builder heat map creation process: 
			Cluster Matrix.</p>
	
			<a name="Cluster"></a>
			<h2>Step 3:  NG-CHM BUILDER: Cluster Matrix </h2>
	
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='images/help/screenCluster.png' height="452" width="800"></p>
	
			<p>Once a matrix has been selected and transformed, the user may begin building the heat map. Indeed, the initial version of the heat map is built and displayed 
			when the Cluster Matrix screen is loaded. The next step in the construction process is to apply an ordering method and cluster the matrix data. A user may choose
			to use original or random matrix order.  Generally, hierarchical clustering is applied to rows, columns, or both.</p>
			
			<p>Utilizing the configuration panel on the Cluster Matrix screen, the user may make the selections necessary to cluster the matrix. Drop-down controls are provided for Order Method, Distance Measure, and 
			Agglomeration Method. Users may select the ordering method for rows and columns.  Various distance measures and agglomeration methods can be selected for clustering rows 
			and columns. Euclidian and Ward generally produce good results.  NOTE: Clustering can take some time if the matrix is large.</p>
			
			<p>If hierarchical ordering is selected, an advanced feature of the Cluster Matrix screen allows for the creation of cluster-based covariate bars for both the row and column axis.
			A cluster-based covariate bar will appear on the heat map with color breaks coinciding with the number of clusters that the user selects in the configuration panel for the bar. The
			screen shot of the Cluster Matrix screen (above) contains an example of cluster-based covariate bars.</p>
	
			<p>The results panel of this screen contains a rendering of the Summary side of the actual NG-CHM Viewer application page. The summary heat map is visible along with any applied
			covariate bars and hierarchical dendrograms.</p>

			<p>Once any desired clustering has been applied, the user may move on to the next step in the NG-CHM Builder heat map creation process: Process Covariates.</p>
	
			<a name="Covariates"></a>
			<h2>Step 4:  NG-CHM BUILDER: Process Covariates </h2>
	
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='images/help/screenCovariates.png' height="452" width="800"></p>
	
			<p>Covariate bars are generated by applying a covariate file to the heat map. They can contain information related to either rows or columns in the data 
			matrix. Covariate bars contain discreet classification data (e.g. sub-type) or continuous data (e.g. age). Column covariate bars, appear in the 
			NG-CHM Viewer at the top of the heat map. Row covariate bars to the left of the map. Discrete covariate bars are displayed as a color bar with 
			different colors associated with each discrete category in the data. Continuous covariate bars can be displayed as a color bar, scatter plot, 
			or bar plot with the color varying in shade between the upper and lower boundaries of the data.</p>
			
			<p>The first step in processing a covariate bar in the NG-CHM builder is to select a covariate file and enter values for display Name, Position (data axis), Color Type 
			(discrete/continuous). A covariate file can be a text or .XLS file. Each row in the file must contain 2 data values: A key value and a data value. These must be separated 
			by a tab in a text file and reside in separate columns in an .XLS file. All key values must match labels found on the data matrix in the appropriate row/column. Once the bar has been added, the user may
			further configure the display of the bar.</p>
			
			<p>Using controls located on the configuration panel of the Process Covariates screen, users may add, remove, and reorder covariate bars as well as modify the appearance of each covariate bar. 
			Select the covariate bar you wish to customize from the Covariates drop-down and the user may then change color settings, size, display type, and whether it should be displayed. For 
			continuous covariate bars, you can also choose an alternate presentation option of barplot or scatter plot. When either of these are selected, the user will be shown a 
			panel containing controls specific to these bar representations.</p>
			
			<p>The results panel of this screen contains a rendering of the Summary side of the actual NG-CHM Viewer application page. The summary heat map is visible along with any applied

			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='images/help/screenFormat.png' height="452" width="800"></p>
		
			<p>The purpose of the Format Heat Map screen is to provide users with a set of tools, displayed in different sub-panels within the configuration panel,
			for formatting various aspects of heat map display.  These tools include: Matrix Colors/Breaks, Heat Map Display, Labels and Attributes, and Heat Map Gaps.
			Each of the panels containing these tools may be toggled open using the Format Tasks drop-down at the top of the configuration panel.</p>
			
			<p>The Matrix Colors tool enables changes to colors and threshold values that assign a color to each cell in the heat map body. 
			The Heat Map Display tool allows users to change the visibility, size, color, and length of objects (e.g. dendrograms, labels, grids, etc...) displayed on the heat map.
			The Labels and Attributes tool permits the addition of label types for linkouts, top items, and heat map level attributes to the heat map. Finally,
			Heat Map Gaps (an advanced feature) allows users to place gaps into the heat map display based upon location or cluster.</p>
			
			<p>The results panel of this screen contains a rendering of the Summary side of the actual NG-CHM Viewer application page. The summary heat map is visible along with any applied
			covariate bars, top items, gaps, and hierarchical dendrograms.</p>

			<p>The final result of the NG-CHM Heat Map build process is the presentation of your completed heat map on the Interactive Heat Map screen.
			This screen leverages the NG-CHM Viewer application, with all of it's features, to display the heat map in a fully interactive presentation.
			The NGCHM Heat Map Viewer is a dynamic, graphical environment for exploration of clustered or non-clustered heat map data. For information on the
			features of the NG-CHM Viewer, please see the <a href="http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/NG-CHM-V2:Overview" target="new">full documentation</a> 
			</p>
	
			<p>The configuration panel for the NG-CHM Builder Interactive Heat Map screen provides a number of options for the user to leverage the heat map that they 
			just constructed. You can explore the map here, but will need to save it locally or download a PDF to view it later. You can get a local copy of the heat map 
			viewer and use it to dynamically explore your map at any time. Please refer to the Configuration Controls list (below) for a description of the features available for 
			saving, printing, and generating images of your newly created heat map.</p>
	
			<p>The results panel of this screen contains a fully-featured embedded version of the NG-CHM Viewer application. The user may interact with the
			heat map freely in this panel. It is also possible, using the Expand Map button, to enlarge the panel to full screen size to better work with your heat map.</p>
